# Steps to follow when you retire or change the name of a technical article

This guidance is for SMEs who are listed as the author of an article that needs to be retired from docs.microsoft.com. The steps also apply if an article's file name is renamed.

If you're a member of the docs.microsoft.com community and you think an article should be retired for any reason, please leave a comment in the Disqus comment stream for the article to let the author know something is wrong with the article.

SME authors need to follow several steps to gracefully retire content so users of the website don't have a bad experience when we retire content from the site. Deleting the article or changing its name should be the last thing that happens!

## Step 1: Set the article to no-index/no-follow and republish it (recommended)

The first thing you should do is republish the article as no-index/no-follow a few weeks before you actually delete it. This is considered the best practice "pre-work" for retiring content. Doing this removes the article from search engine indexes so people won't find the article in search. [See the internal wiki for details.](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/azurecontentguidance/wiki/Pages/Remove%20published%20pages%20and%20request%20redirects.aspx)

## Step 2: Manage inbound links (required)

Determine if there are any non-Microsoft inbound links to your content. Frequently, blogs, forums, and other content on the web points to articles. Frequently, you can work with blog owners to change these links, and you can remove or update links from forum posts. Web analytics tools can tell you if there are any high traffic inbound links you might need to manage in this way.

## Step 3: Remove all crosslinks to the article from the technical content repository (required)

Do not rely on redirects to take care of crosslinks from other articles. Update or remove the cross references to the article you are deleting or renaming, including in articles owned by other people.

1. Ensure you are working in an up-to-date local branch â€“ run `git pull upstream master` (or the appropriate variation on this command.

2.	Scan the appropriate repository folders for any articles and includes that link to the article you want to retire, and either remove the crosslinks or replace them with an appropriate new crosslinks. You can use a search and replace utility to find the crosslinks if you have one installed. If you don't, you can use Windows PowerShell for free! Here's how to use PowerShell to find the crosslinks:

 a. Start Windows PowerShell.

 b. At the PowerShell prompt, change into the azure-content-pr\articles folder:

 `cd <repository-name>

 c. Type this command, which will list all files that contain a reference to the article you are deleting:

 `Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Include *.md* | Select-String "<the name of the topic you are deleting>" | group path | select name`

  If you prefer to send the list of file names to a text file (in this case, named psoutput.txt), you can:

  `Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Include *.md* | Select-String "<the name of the topic you are deleting>" | group path | select name | Out-File C:\Users\<your account>\psoutput.txt`

3. Add and commit all your changes, push them to your fork, and create a pull request to move your changes from your fork to the master branch of the main repository.

## Step 4: Update the FWLink tool (required)

Check the FWLink tool for any FWLinks that might point to the article. Point any FWLinks at replacement content; if you are not on the internal alias that owns the link, join it. If the owners won't update the link, file a ticket with MSCOM to have the link changed. More info - [internal wiki](http://sharepoint/sites/azurecontentguidance/wiki/Pages/Manage%20inbound%20links%20to%20retired%20topics.aspx).

## Step 5: Retire the article

After you've completed the prior steps and those changes are live, you can delete the article from the repository. 

**Important:** When you delete files, you must use the `git add -A` command.

## Step 6: Remove any links from MSDN articles (required)

Review the content QA tool for broken links to the retired or renamed topic and remove/fix the links in all MSDN topics affected.

## Step 7: Remove cached pages from search engines (only if absolutely necessary)

Do this ONLY if the content needs to be removed quickly due to legal or severe customer issues. Per best practices from Google, normal priority page deletions should just be handled by natural search engine processes. Go to these web pages to remove cached web pages from search engines:
